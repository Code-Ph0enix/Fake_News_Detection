# Fake_News_Detection
The project aims to develop a machine-learning model capable of identifying and classifying any news article as fake or not. The distribution of fake news can potentially have highly adverse effects on people and culture. This project involves building and training a model to classify news as fake news or not using a diverse dataset of news articles. We have used four techniques to determine the results of the model:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes 
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier


# Problem Definition
In the era of digital information, the rapid spread of fake news has become a significant problem, affecting public opinion, political landscapes, and societal trust. News articles, particularly those shared through social media platforms, may contain misleading or completely fabricated information. The challenge is to automatically distinguish between fake and real news based on the text, style, and structure of the articles.
The goal is to build a classification model that can take a given news article as input and predict whether it is "fake" or "real." The solution will involve preprocessing the news articles, extracting features from the text (such as word frequency, sentiment, n-grams, etc.), and applying machine learning algorithms to classify the articles.
